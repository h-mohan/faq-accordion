## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my solution to this front-end coding challenge!

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help developers like me improve our coding skills by building realistic projects.

**For this challenge, I used my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional FAQ accordion.**

## The Challenge

My goal was to build out an FAQ accordion that closely matches the provided design. Key requirements included:

- Ability to hide/show answers when questions are clicked
- Keyboard navigation support for accessing questions and toggling answers
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
- Hover and focus states for interactive elements

## Project Overview

### What I Did
- Created a responsive FAQ accordion using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Implemented interactive features with smooth transitions.
- Ensured the design is accessible and follows best practices.

### Key Features
- **Interactive Accordion**: Users can toggle answers by clicking on questions.
- **Responsive Layout**: The design adjusts to various screen sizes, including mobile and desktop views.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Accessible navigation through questions using keyboard interactions.
- **Visual Feedback**: Hover and focus states are styled for a better user experience.

## Where to Find Everything

The project files and design assets are organized as follows:

- **Designs**: Located in the `/design` folder, including both mobile and desktop versions of the design.
- **Assets**: Found in the `/assets` folder, with optimized images and font files.
- **Style Guide**: The `style-guide.md` file contains important design specifications, including color palette and fonts.
